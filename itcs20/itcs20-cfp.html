The <b>11th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS)</b> conference will be held at the <b>University of Washington</b> in Seattle, Washington from  <b>January 12-14, 2020</b>. See the <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shayan/itcs2020/index.html">local arrangements</a> website for registration and local information. 
<!--See the <a href="">conference website</a> for local information. -->
</p>

<p>
ITCS seeks to promote research that carries a strong conceptual message (e.g., introducing a new concept, model or understanding, opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas, introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques). ITCS welcomes both conceptual and technical contributions whose contents will advance and inspire the greater theory community.

<h3>Submissions</h3><hr>
<p>
Authors should upload a PDF of the paper to easychair using the folloing link: <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=itcs20">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=itcs20</a>. The font size should be at least 11 point and the paper should be single column. Beyond these, there are no formatting requirements. Authors are required to submit a COI declaration upon submission.
</p><p>
<b>Submissions should not have the authors' names on them</b>. Instead, author and institution information is to be uploaded separately. PC members will still be able to access author names in the reviewing process if they feel they need to; the intent of this procedure is to make it easier for PC members to remove unconscious biases. You are free to post your paper on arXiv, etc.
</p><p>
Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large. The submission should include proofs of all central claims. In addition, it is recommended for the paper to contain, within the first 10 pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations, and place within (or outside) of our field's scope and literature. The committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly and in the simplest possible way what the paper is accomplishing.
</p><p>
All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.
</p>

<!--
<p> <b> <a href = "https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itcs2019">Submit here.</a></b>
-->
</p>
 

<h3>Prior, simultaneous, and subsequent submissions</h3><hr>
<p>
Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS. Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed. Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.
</p>

<h3>Online posting</h3><hr>
<p>
Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arxiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. We expect that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins.
</p>

<h3>Accepted papers</h3><hr>
<p>
Accepted papers must be presented orally at the conference by one or more of the authors. There are two types of presentation: either a regular talk (the length of which will be determined by the PC based on the entire pool of accepted papers), or a short oral presentation (3-5 minutes) followed by a presentation as a poster at an evening session.
</p>
<p>At submission time, authors will have the choice of submitting their paper for consideration as a "regular talk only" or "regular talk or short presentation + poster". The decision of accepting a paper as a regular talk or as a short presentation + poster will be made independently of the authors' declared choice. Authors that select "regular talk only" opt out of the option to have their paper accepted and given a short presentation + poster; authors that select "regular talk or short presentation + poster" will be awarded a regular talk if their paper is accepted for both categories.
</p><p>
	Irrespective of the type of presentation allotted, all accepted papers will appear, without distinction, in the ITCS conference proceedings. 
</p><p>
Conference attendees are expected to abide by an anti-harassment <a href="http://itcs-conf.org/itcs20/itcs20-conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
</p>
<!--
<p>
The list of accepted papers is available <a href="https://itcsconf.github.io/itcs18/itcs18-accepted.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Graduating bits</h3><hr>
<p>
Participants near to graduation (on either side) will be given 4 minutes to present their results, research, plans, personality, and so on. This is one of the important traditions of ITCS, and not to be missed!
</p>

<h3>Proceedings</h3><hr>
<p>
Typical accepted papers will be published in an electronic proceedings of the conference. To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask the PC chair to have only a one page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the PDF of the full paper on an online archive. 
</p>

<h3>Awards</h3><hr>
<p>
The committee may award a "best student paper" award.
