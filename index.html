The <b>15th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS)</b> conference will take place at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing on the University of California, Berkeley campus.  
It will be held <b>in person</b> from Tuesday, January 30 to Friday February 2, 2024. The conference will run in a single track and all
sessions will take place at the Calvin Lab auditorium.
<p></p>
 
  <p>
    ITCS seeks to promote research with innovative or bold agendas, which could be conceptual, technical, or methodological, and whose message  will advance and inspire the greater theory community.  The program committee welcomes papers introducing a new concept, model or understanding; opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas; introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques; putting forth a bold, 
even if preliminary, vision or line of attack; or unearthing novel or surprising connections between different topics.

<h3><a href="https://itcsconf.github.io/itcs24/itcs24-cfp.html">Call for Papers</a></h3><hr>

	<!--
<p>
</p><h3>Submission Instructions</h3><hr>
	<p>
Authors should register and submit their paper via <a href="https://itcs2024.hotcrp.com">the hotcrp submission site</a>, by the above <b>strict</b> 
		deadlines. The font size should be at least 11 point and
the paper should be single column. Beyond these, there are no
formatting requirements.
Authors are required to submit a COI declaration upon submission.
</p><p>
The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing
process. <b>Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors
in any way.</b> In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email
addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the
submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded
separately on the submission site.)
The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and
external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without
unconscious bias, and is not intended to make it impossible for them
to discover who the authors are. Nothing should be done in the name of
anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing
the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should
not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to
disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they
normally would. For example, authors may (and are in fact encouraged
to) post their papers to arXiv/ECCC/IACR etc.
</p><p>
Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to
experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large.
The submission should include clear proofs of all central claims. In
addition, it is strongly recommended that the paper contain, within
the first 10 pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of
the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations,
and place within (or outside) of our field's scope and literature. The
committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly, in as
simple and straightforward a manner as possible, what the paper
accomplishes.
</p>
    <p>Submissions authored by program committee members (with the
exception of the PC chair) are allowed. Utmost care will be taken to
avoid COIs with PC submissions, ensuring that such submissions receive
no unfair advantage, and that the reviews and the discussion remain
confidential from the authors.
    </p><p>
All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be
disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition,
the program committee may consult with journal editors and program
chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as
parallel submissions.
</p>
<p></p>
	
<h3>Prior, simultaneous, and subsequent submissions</h3><hr>
<p>
Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS. Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed. Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.
</p>
-->
	
<h3>Online posting</h3>
<p>
Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arxiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. It is generally expected that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins.
</p>
