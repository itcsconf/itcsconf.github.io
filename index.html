<h3>The ITCS Conferences</h3><hr>

Theoretical computer science has produced a remarkable wealth of beautiful ideas with tremendous impact on computer science and beyond. Some of the most powerful contributions, such as P versus NP, pseudo randomness, zero-knowledge proofs, PCP, quantum computers, boosting, etc, represent not only major technical breakthroughs, but also distill fundamental computational concepts and make deep connections between different fields and areas.  STOC and FOCS played a critical role in nurturing these
connections when the field was smaller and more intimate, by providing
a forum where essential new ideas could be distilled, rapidly
communicated, assimilated, discussed and reinterpreted. With the
growth of the theoretical computer science and the corresponding deluge of information, what
is the most effective role that a conference can play in facilitating the type
of dialog necessary for future powerful contributions to the field? The quest of
ITCS is to embody the answer to this question.

<br>
<br>
Dialog and discussions between sub-areas of ITCS are facilitated by organizing
ITCS as a single track conference, with "Chair rants" helping provide the context
for each session. Moreover, submissions, refereeing and presentations emphasize
the I in ITCS: new concepts or models, new lines of inquiry, new techniques or novel
use of existing techniques, and new connections between areas. Communication is
further aided by rapid dissemination (four months from submission to conference),
and free access via electronic proceedings.

<h3>ITCS 2017</h3><hr>

The <b>8th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS)</b> conference will be held in <b>Berkeley</b>, during <b>January 9-11 2017</b>, and will be sponsored by the <b>Simons Institute</b>. Submissions will be hosted by <b><a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itcs2017"> EasyChair </a> </b>.
