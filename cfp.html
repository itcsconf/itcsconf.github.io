The <b>8th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS)</b> conference will be held in <b>Berkeley</b>, during <b>January 9-11 2017</b>, and will be sponsored by the <b>Simons Institute</b>.
</p>

<p>
ITCS seeks to promote research that carries a strong conceptual message (e.g., introducing a new concept or model, opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas, introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques). ITCS welcomes all submissions, whether aligned with current theory of computation research directions or deviating from them.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2849">the recent blog post</a> about ITCS 2016 and 2017.

<h3>Organizers</h3><hr>

<h3>Program committee</h3><hr>

<h3>Submission format</h3><hr>
<p>
Authors may either submit a link to their paper on an online archive (ECCC, arXiv, or Crypto ePrint), or they can upload a pdf of the paper on the submission server (in this case the submission will be treated as confidential).
</p>

<p>
In keeping with the Innovations theme of the conference, the authors are invited to include in their submission a <b>statement (up to 1,000 words)</b> complementing the paper's introduction so as to inform the committee members (in a more detailed and free-style way than is usually done in an introduction) about the paper's significance, innovative nature, key technical ideas, and place within (or outside…) our field's scope and literature (if you feel this is self-evident, your statement can simply say that). Think of it as an opportunity to write a favorable referee report about, or a review of, your paper! 
</p>

<p>
Authors should strive to make their paper, and especially their statement, accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large. It is typically wise for the paper to contain, within its first few pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline (similar to a brief oral presentation) of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The paper should also allow reviewers to easily expand their understanding of any specific detail they deem important for evaluating the submission. 
</p>

<h3>Prior, simultaneous, and subsequent submissions</h3><hr>
Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS. Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed. Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.

<h3>Accepted papers</h3><hr>
Papers accepted to the conference must be presented at the conference by one or more of the authors. The exact schedule of presentations, including the time allotted for each presentation (which may vary for different presentations), will be decided based on the pool of accepted papers. 

<h3>Invited papers</h3><hr>
The program committee may invite individuals to present their specific significant recent work at the conference. Submitted papers may be elevated to “invited” status at the discretion of the committee.

<h3>Poster session</h3><hr>
A poster session may be arranged by the program committee.

<h3>Graduating bits</h3><hr>
Participants within a couple of years (either way) of PhD graduation will be given 5 minutes to present their results, research, plans, personality, and so on. This is one of the important traditions of ITCS, and a sublime moment every year!

<h3>Proceedings</h3><hr>
Accepted and invited papers will appear in electronic proceedings.

<h3>Paper Submission</h3><hr>
You may submit online at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itcs2017"> https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itcs2017 <a>.
