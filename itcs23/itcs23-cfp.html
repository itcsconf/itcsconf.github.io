The <b>14th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS)</b> conference will take place at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It will be held <b>in person</b> from January 11 to January 13, 2023.
</p>

<p>
ITCS seeks to promote research that carries a strong conceptual message (e.g., introducing a new concept, model or understanding, opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas, introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques).
ITCS welcomes both conceptual and technical contributions whose contents will advance and inspire the greater theory community.

<h3>Submissions</h3><hr>
<p>
Authors should upload a PDF of the paper to a link that will be posted at a later date. The font size should be at least 11 point and the paper should be single column. Beyond these, there are no formatting requirements.
Authors are required to submit a COI declaration upon submission.
</p><p>
<b>Submissions should not have the authors' names on them</b>. Instead, author and institution information is to be uploaded separately. PC members will still be able to access author names in the reviewing process if they feel they need to; the intent of this procedure is to make it easier for PC members to remove unconscious biases. You are free (and encouraged) to post your paper on your web page, the arXiv, etc.
</p><p>
Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large. The submission should include proofs of all central claims. In addition, it is recommended that the paper contain, within the first 10 pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations, and place within (or outside) of our field's scope and literature. The committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly, in as simple and straightforward a manner as possible, what the paper accomplishes.
</p><p>
All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.
</p>
</p>

<h3>Prior, simultaneous, and subsequent submissions</h3><hr>
<p>
Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS. Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed. Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.
</p>

<h3>Online posting</h3><hr>
<p>
Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arxiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. We expect that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins.
</p>

<h3>Accepted papers</h3><hr>
<p>
A talk accompanying each accepted paper will be streamed live during the conference by one or more of the authors
(details forthcoming). 
</p>
<p>
Conference attendees are expected to abide by an anti-harassment <a href="itcs21/itcs21-conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
</p>
<!--
<p>
The list of accepted papers is available <a href="https://itcsconf.github.io/itcs18/itcs18-accepted.html">here</a>.
</p>
-->

<h3>Graduating bits</h3><hr>
<p>
Participants near to graduation (on either side) will be given an opportunity to present their results, research, plans, personality, and so on during the "Graduating bits" session.  This is one of the important traditions of ITCS, and not to be missed!
</p>

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3><hr>
<p>
ITCS is committed to an inclusive conference experience, respectful of all participants, and free from any discrimination or harassment, including unwelcome advances or propositions of an intimate nature, particularly 
    when coming from a more senior researcher to a less senior one. All ITCS attendees are expected to behave accordingly. If you experience or witness discrimination, 
    harassment or other unethical behavior at the conference, we encourage you to seek advice by contacting SafeToC advocates (<a href="http://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/">http://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/</a>)
