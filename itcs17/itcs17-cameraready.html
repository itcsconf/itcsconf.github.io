<h3>Camera Ready</h3>

The deadline for submitting the camera-ready version of accepted papers is <b>January 2nd</b>.
<br>
Please return all files required to compile the properly formatted manuscript (including latex, bib, and any image files), as well as the signed author agreement form, by email to christos@berkeley.edu.
<br><br>
Submissions should be formatted using the LIPIcs LaTeX style availble <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/lipics-v2016/lipics-v2016-authors.tgz">here</a>. Please make sure to include ACM 1998 classification and topical keywords; these are strictly required.
<br><br>
There is no page limit. In keeping with the spirit of conference proceedings, we encourage you to submit a reader-friendly manuscript of 12-15 pages at most, with the possibility of an appendix. No strict limit will be enforced.
<br><br>
Please also print, sign, and return (a scan of) the <a href="lipics-itcs2017-author-agreement.pdf">Author Agreement form</a>.
<br><br>
As much as possible, we would appreciate if you could conform to the following typesetting rules:
<ul>
<li> Use pdflatex and an up-to-date LaTeX system.
<li> Use further LaTeX packages only if required. Avoid usage of packages
like enumitem, enumerate, cleverref, natbib, wrapfig. Keep it simple,
i.e. use as few additional packages as possible.
<li> Add custom made macros carefully and only those which are needed in
the article (i.e., do not simply add your convolute of macros
collected over the years).
<li> Do not use a different main font. For example, the usage of the
times-package is forbidden.
<li> Provide full author names (especially with regard to the first name)
in the \author macro and in the \Copyright macro.
<li> Fill out the \subjclass and \keywords macros. For the \subjclass,
please refer to the <a href="http://www.acm.org/about/class/ccs98-html">ACM classification</a>.
<li> Take care of suitable linebreaks and pagebreaks. No overfull \hboxes
should occur in the warnings log.
<li> Provide suitable graphics of at least 300dpi (preferrably in pdf
format).
<li> Use the provided sectioning macros: \section, \subsection,
\subsection*, \paragraph, \subparagraph*, ... “Self-made” sectioning
commands (for example, \noindent{\bf My subparagraph.} will be removed
and replaced by standard LIPIcs style sectioning commands.
<li> Do not alter the spacing of the lipics-v2016.cls style file. Such
modifications will be removed.
<li> Do not use conditional structures to include/exclude content.
Instead, please provide only the content that should be published – in
one file – and nothing else.
<li> Remove all comments, especially avoid commenting large text blocks
and using \iffalse ... \fi constructions.
* Keep the standard style (plainurl) for the bibliography as provided
by the sample article. (natbib will be disabled.)
<li> Use BibTex and provide exactly one BibTex file for your article. The
BibTex file should contain only entries that are referenced in the
article, preferably with a DOI. Please make sure that there are no
errors and warnings with the referenced BibTex entries.
<li> Use a spellchecker to get rid of typos.
<li> A manual for the LIPIcs style is available <a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/lipics/lipics-authors-v2016/lipics-manual-v2016.pdf">here</a>.
