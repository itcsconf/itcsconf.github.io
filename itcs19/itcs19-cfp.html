The <b>10th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS)</b> conference will be held at <b>UCSD</b> in San Diego, California from  <b>January 10-12, 2019</b>. 
<!--See the <a href="">conference website</a> for local information. -->
</p>

<p>
ITCS seeks to promote research that carries a strong conceptual message (e.g., introducing a new concept, model or understanding, opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas, introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques). ITCS welcomes both conceptual and technical contributions whose contents will advance and inspire the greater theory community.

<h3>Submissions</h3><hr>
<p>
<!--Specific submissions instructions will be up shortly. -->
Authors should <a href = "https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=itcs2019">upload a PDF of the paper to easychair</a>. 
The font size should be at least 11 point and the paper should be single column. Beyond these, there are no formatting requirements.  
</p>
<p>
<b>Submissions should not have the authors' names on them</b>.  Instead, author and institution information is to be uploaded separately.  PC members will still be able to access author names in the reviewing process if they feel they need to: for instance, if it is necessary to send the paper to a subreferee, they can make sure the subreferee is not an author, or if your paper improves over the recent work of [1], PC members may wish to see if [1] is you.  However, the intent of this procedure is to make it easier for PC members to remove unconscious biases.  You are free to post your paper on ArXiv, etc.
</p>
</p>
<p>
Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large. It is typically wise for the paper to contain, within its first few pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations, and place within (or outside) of our field's scope and literature. Included here should be an overview (similar to a brief oral presentation) of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. <em>The committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly and in the simplest possible way what the paper is accomplishing. In particular, authors are encouraged to provide as much intuition as possible.</em>  While there is no official limit on the length of a submission, PC members are not responsible for reading beyond the first ten pages.   However, the paper should also allow PC members to easily expand their understanding of any specific detail they deem important for evaluating the submission.

<h3>Prior, simultaneous, and subsequent submissions</h3><hr>
<p>
Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS. Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed. Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.
</p>

<h3>Accepted papers</h3><hr>
<p>
Papers accepted to the conference must be presented at the conference by one or more of the authors. The exact schedule of presentations, including the time allotted for each presentation, will be decided based on the pool of accepted papers.  The PC may, for instance, choose to allocate some accepted papers a 20-minute slot and others a shorter slot plus a poster presentation at an evening poster session.  Conference attendees will be expected to abide by an anti-harassment code of conduct <a href="http://www.sigecom.org/ec18/codeofconduct.html">such as those at recent TCS conferences</a>.
</p>
<!--
<p>
The list of accepted papers is available <a href="https://itcsconf.github.io/itcs18/itcs18-accepted.html">here</a>.
</p>
-->

<h3>Invited poster presentations</h3><hr>
<p>
The program committee may invite individuals to present recent work at a poster presentation.
</p>

<h3>Graduating bits</h3><hr>
<p>
Participants near to graduation (on either side) will be given 5 minutes to present their results, research, plans, personality, and so on. This is one of the important traditions of ITCS, and not to be missed!
</p>

<h3>Proceedings</h3><hr>
<p>
Typical accepted papers will be
<!-- allocated roughly ten pages (exact length to be determined later), for publication-->
published in an electronic proceedings of the conference. To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask the PC chair to have only a one page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the PDF of the full paper on an online archive. This option is available to accommodate publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in a conference proceedings. 
</p>

<h3>Awards</h3><hr>
<p>
The committee may award a "best student paper" award.
