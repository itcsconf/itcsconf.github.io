    	<br>
    	I primarily work in approximation algorithms, online algorithms, and game theory. However, considerable part of my research time is also devoted solving more applied problems. My work has appeared in STOC, FOCS, OSDI, and SIGCOMM. Here are my main research themes: Data Center Scheduling and Routing (we develop new models and algorithms for scheduling and routing problems that arise in large data centers and big data applications); Fundamental Optimization Problems (we give first algorithms for several long standing open problems); Price of Anarchy Analysis Via Duality (we introduce and develop duality based techniques to bound robust PoA).

A main theme of my research is studying random graph processes that arise in computer science. Two of my favourite ones include rumour spreading and dynamic load balancing.

My research looks, through the Lens of Theoretical Computer Science, at a variety of problems from the studies of Evolution, Statistics, Stopping Theory, and Game Theory. Two lines of works that I am particularly thrilled about are: (1) understanding the terrain of computational complexity between P and NP, and (2) understanding mechanism design subject to simplicity constraints.

    	Henry is motivated by a simple but fundamental question: What are the ultimate limits of computation and information processing in the physical universe? To answer this question he uses tools from complexity theory, cryptography, and quantum information. Much of his research has focused on the complexity and cryptographic aspects of quantum entanglement. He recently completed his Ph.D. at MIT, advised by Dana Moshkovitz, and is now a postdoc at UC Berkeley.
