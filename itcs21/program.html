   <h1>ITCS 2021 Program and Schedule</h1>
   </p>

   <p style="clear: both;">
   Welcome to ITCS 2021.  The conference is virtual, being hosted on the Simons Institute <em>gather.town map</em>,
   where you can meet and chat with other attendees and access both Lecture Rooms (Room A and Room B).
   The sessions will take place as Zoom webinars and can also be accessed via the links in the schedule below.
   </p>

   
   <p>
   In the schedule, you can find preliminary versions of each paper (in PDF format)
   and recorded videos of longer presentations.
   You can join the ITCS 2021 slack by <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/itcs2021/shared_invite/zt-kdww5nz5-MBq1HW1gaSw9usLKBCpi5A">clicking here</a>.
   There is a <a href="https://itcs2021.slack.com/">slack channel</a> associated to every paper where
   one can ask questions or enter discussions with the authors and other conference attendees.
   </p>

   <p>
   <strong>Session and talk format:</strong>  Each session is one hour long, composed of <em>five</em> (with a few exceptions)
   8-minute live presentations.  Following the presentations, there is a 20-minute "panel discussion" period whose
   format is decided by the session chair.  This is an opportunity for the audience to ask questions, or for
   the chair to facilitate a discussion among the speakers.  The sessions generally alternate between Room A and Room B
   so that if panel discussions run long, they don't cut into the next session.
   </p>

   <p>
   <strong>Registration:</strong>
   In order to have the option to be seen/heard during the sessions,
   you must <a href="https://www.tfaforms.com/4874200">register here</a>.  Note that registration is free,
   and it is intended that all participants should register.
   </p>

   <p>
   <strong>Graduating bits:</strong> As is tradition at ITCS, there will be a "Graduating Bits (GB)" session intended for
   conference participants who are near to graduation (on either side)
   and wish to present their results, research, plans, personality, etc.
   This will take place at 09:30AM on January 7th (in the second session of the day).
   <em>If you wish to participate, contact the GB organizer Gautam Kamath (<tt>g@csail.mit.edu</tt>) as soon as possible.</em>
   In your email, please include basic information (year or intended year of graduation, university, PhD advisor, thesis topic).
   </p>

   <p>
   <strong>Code of conduct:</strong> ITCS is committed to an inclusive
   conference experience, respectful of all participants, and free from any
   discrimination or harassment, including unwelcome advances or propositions
   of an intimate nature, particularly when coming from a more senior
   researcher to a less senior one. All ITCS attendees are expected to behave
   accordingly.
   If you experience or witness discrimination, harassment or other unethical
   behavior at the conference, we encourage you to <a href="http://itcs-conf.org/itcs21/itcs21-conduct.html">seek advice and remedy</a>.

   </p>

   All times are in PST (California time zone).
