The <b>9th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS)</b> conference will be held at <b>MIT</b> in Cambridge, Massachusetts from  <b>January 11-14, 2018</b>.
</p>

<p>
ITCS seeks to promote research that carries a strong conceptual message (e.g., introducing a new concept, model or understanding, opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas, introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques). ITCS welcomes both conceptual and technical contributions whose contents will advance and inspire the greater theory community.

<h3>Submission</h3><hr>
<p>
Authors may either submit a link to the PDF of their paper on an online archive (ECCC, arXiv, or Crypto ePrint), or they can upload a PDF of the paper to the submission server (in this case the submission will be treated as confidential). Submission will be to easychair (link coming soon).
</p><p>
Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large. It is typically wise for the paper to contain, within its first few pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations, and place within (or outside) of our field’s scope and literature. Included here should be an overview (similar to a brief oral presentation) of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. The committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly and in the simplest possible way what the paper is accomplishing. In particular, authors are encouraged to provide as much intuition as possible.  While there is no official limit on the length of a submission, PC members may not read beyond the first ten pages of the submission. However, the paper should also allow PC members to easily expand their understanding of any specific detail they deem important for evaluating the submission.
</p>

<h3>Prior, simultaneous, and subsequent submissions</h3><hr>
<p>
Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS. Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed. Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.
</p>

<h3>Accepted papers</h3><hr>
<p>
Papers accepted to the conference must be presented at the conference by one or more of the authors. The exact schedule of presentations, including the time allotted for each presentation (which may vary for different presentations, but will not be less than 15 minutes), will be decided based on the pool of accepted papers.
</p>

<h3>Invited presentations</h3><hr>
<p>
The program committee may invite individuals to present their specific recent work at the conference.  
</p>

<h3>Poster session</h3><hr>
<p>
A poster session may be arranged by the program committee.
</p>

<h3>Graduating bits</h3><hr>
<p>
Participants within a couple of years (either way) of PhD graduation will be given 5 minutes to present their results, research, plans, personality, and so on. This is one of the important traditions of ITCS, and a sublime moment every year!
</p>

<h3>Proceedings</h3><hr>
<p>
Typical accepted papers will be allocated roughly ten pages (exact length to be determined later), for publication in an electronic proceedings of the conference. To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask the PC chair to have only a one page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the PDF of the full paper on an online archive. This option is available to accommodate publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in a conference proceedings. 
</p>

<h3>Awards</h3><hr>
<p>
The committee may award a “best student paper” award.
